# Principles of operation
This adapter's operations focus on data collection and stream creation.  
## Adapter configuration  
For the OPC UA adapter to start data collection, configure the following:

- Data source: Provide the data source from which the adapter should collect data.  
- Data selection: Select the OPC UA items to which the adapter should subscribe for data.  
- Logging: Set up the logging attributes to manage the adapter logging behavior.

## Connection  
The OPC UA adapter uses the binary opc.tcp protocol to communicate with the OPC UA servers. As part of the OPC UA server and client establishing a secure connection, each one sends its X.509-type certificate to the other for verification. Upon verification of the certificates, the server and client establish a secure connection.

## Data collection  
The OPC UA adapter collects time-series data from selected OPC UA dynamic variables through OPC UA subscriptions (unsolicited reads). The adapter supports the Data Access (DA) and Historical Data Access (HDA) parts of OPC UA specification. For more information, see [Data Access](https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/documents/view/165) and [Historical Data Access](https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/documents/view/168).

### Data types  
The following table lists OPC UA variable types that the adapter collects data from and types of streams that will be created. Types not listed below are currently unsupported.

| OPC UA data type | Stream data type |  
|:---|:---|  
| Boolean | Boolean |  
| SByte | Int16 |  
| Int16 | Int16 |  
| UInt16 | UInt16 |  
| Int32 | Int32 |  
| UInt32 | UInt32 |  
| Int64 | Int64 |  
| UInt64 | UInt64 |  
| Double | Float64 |  
| Decimal | Float32 |  
| Float | Float32 |  
| DateTime | DateTime |  
| UtcTime | DateTime |  
| String | String |  
| Number | variable, depending on the actual value |  
| Integer | Integer |  
| UInteger | UInteger |  
| Enumeration | Int16 |

AVEVA Adapter for OPC UA attempts to verify the data type for each data selection item before adding the item to the subscription on the OPC UA server. Verified data selection items with supported types and data selection items for which the type cannot be verified are added to the subscription. Data selection items with unsupported data type are not added to the subscription and a message including the **NodeId** and **TypeId** is logged.

## Enumeration types  
AVEVA Adapter for OPC UA supports the following enumeration types:

- MultiStateDiscreteType  
- MultiStateValueDiscreteType  
- TwoStateDiscreteType  
- Any object that has a data type referenced as enumeration type

The adapter reads the enumeration mapping for data selection items that point to any of the enumeration types and sends these items as enums to the OMF endpoints.

## Stream creation
The OPC UA adapter creates a stream with three properties for each selected OPC UA item. The properties are described in the following table:
| Property name | Data type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Timestamp | DateTime | Timestamp of the given OPC UA item value update. |
| Value | Based on type of incoming OPC UA value | Value of the given OPC UA item update, which includes multiple properties in addition to the data value. **Note:** For OPC UA items that support EURange, the additional **Minimum**/**Maximum** properties in OCS and the **Zero**/**Span** properties in AVEVA Web API are populated. For OPC UA items that support EngineeringUnits, such as AnalogItem, the additional **UOM** property in OCS and the **Eng Units** property in AVEVA Web API are populated. 1 |
| Quality | Unsigned integer | Data quality of the given OPC UA item update. |

1 **Note:**  `Null` values with `Good` quality are discarded. `Null` values with `Bad` or `Questionable` quality send the default value `0` or `null` to the destination.

The OPC UA adapter sends metadata with each stream it creates. Metadata common for every adapter type are:

-   **ComponentId**: Specifies the data source. For example,  _OpcUa1_
-   **ComponentType**: Specifies the type of adapter. For example,  _OpcUa_

Metadata specific to the OPC UA adapter are:

-   **BrowseName**: The browse name as provided by the OPC UA server
-   **SourceId**: The NodeId provided by the OPC UA server

**Note:**  A configured metadata level allows you to set the amount of metadata for the adapter. Specify the metadata level in the  [General configuration](https://docs.aveva.com/bundle/aveva-adapter-opc-ua/page/main/shared-content/configuration/diagnostics-and-metadata.html). For the OPC UA adapter, the following metadata is sent for the individual level:

-   `None`: No metadata
-   `Low`: AdapterType (ComponentType) and DataSource (ComponentId)
-   `Medium`: AdapterType (ComponentType), DataSource (ComponentId), BrowseName, and DisplayName
-   `High`: AdapterType (ComponentType), DataSource (ComponentId), BrowseName, DisplayName, and SourceId

Each stream created by the adapter for a given OPC UA item has a unique identifier (Stream ID). If you specify a custom stream ID for the OPC UA item in data selection configuration, the OPC UA adapter uses that stream ID to create the stream. Otherwise, the adapter uses the OPC UA item node ID to construct the stream ID, as shown below.

```code
<AdapterComponentID>.<NamespaceIndex>.<Identifier>
```

NamespaceIndex refers to the number specified in the  `ns`  keyword in the  **NodeId**  parameter of the data selection configuration item. For more information, see  [AVEVA Adapter for OPC UA data source configuration](https://docs.aveva.com/bundle/aveva-adapter-opc-ua/page/configuration/data-source.html#opc-ua-data-source-parameters).

**Note:**  The naming convention is affected by StreamPrefix and DefaultStreamIdPattern settings in the data source configuration.
